# Python Flask CRUD Operations server - EMPLOYEE MICROSERVICE
This is an educational project for the purpose of learning flask fw
and editional concepts and technologies like:

### Requirements (dependencies) note:
I used `pipreqs /path/to/project` to update requirements automatically
so they can be installed automatically with the command:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
if any libraries are added to the project they should be updated 
in the relevant requirements.txt files!
